```

The goal of this script is the following in psuedocode
1) figure out how to calculate group centroids with vegan::vegdist
2) get Bray-curtis dissimilarities between each PCR rep of a biological sample and the bio group centroid
3) eliminate reads by proportion - OR RANK-proprotion i think - and plot the dissimilarity for each bio rep
4) to create Eily's nifty dream scatter plot
