# Gallego et al. Hood Canal and San Juan Island Community Data
Starting with ASV hash table scripts filter out seriously low read PCR replicates and explore: 
 * variance between PCR/technical replicates of single ASVs
 * variance between bottle/biological replicates of singles ASVs
 * variance between PCR replicates of the community of ASVs
 * variance between bottle replicates of the community of ASVs
