Practical application of metabarcoding analyses requires datasets to be reliable, predictably generated from environmental samples. Such reliability demands, in turn, that we understand the sources of variability in the steps of the analytical process leading from sample to result. Here we describe variation among technical and biological replicates in a set of DNA sequencing runs, and discuss the likely causes of such variation in the context of stochastic processes leading to metabarcoding datasets. By quantifying the sources of this variation, we hope to (1) help parameterize models linking biological sources of DNA to observed sequence abundances, and (2) make possible calculations of statistical power for purposes of study design.
