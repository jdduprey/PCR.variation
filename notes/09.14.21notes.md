(in the meantime, following up on my meeting w Helen: I think it might be really good to make a function that takes as input a long-format table with columns for DNA reads, technical replicate number, biological replicate number, and site number. The function would then do a pairwise distance matrix and subset the relevant elements to make a list of outputs: a distribution of distances within biological replicate (between technical replicates), a distribution of distances among biological replicates (within site, carefully not double-counting technical replicate comparisons), and a distribution of distances among sites. We could then use those distributions to derive the variance components we care about.

-> number of reads vs presence/absence among technical replicates...
--> more specifically, do we see presence AND absence within a group of replicates (bottles or PCRS), more often when reads are low?
