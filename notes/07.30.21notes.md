RYAN TECHNICAL VS BIOLOGICAL VARIANCE wooo
community level BC, beta, what fraction of difference is due to biological
technical -> pairwise

one ASV -> different measure of variability through technical and biological
processes

==== 9 reps within one biological replicate =====
some true value of number of amplicons for beaver, that is our mean,
distribution around the mean, estimate by looking at 3 technical replicates
looking at 3*3 biological replicates around true mean
